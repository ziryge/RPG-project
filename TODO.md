# TODO for Full RPG Game Implementation

- [ ] Define Player and Enemy classes with attributes (health, mana, attack, defense, level, experience, inventory)
- [ ] Implement main game loop with dungeon exploration, random enemy encounters, and post-fight actions (loot, heal)
- [ ] Complete fight actions: Attack (reduce enemy health), Spell (consume mana, apply effects), Defend (reduce damage taken)
- [ ] Add leveling system: Gain XP from fights, level up to increase stats
- [ ] Add inventory system: Collect items from enemies, use potions for healing
- [ ] Add multiple enemy types with varying stats
- [ ] Include win/lose conditions: Player wins by clearing dungeon, loses if health reaches 0
- [ ] Add simple story intro and outro
- [ ] Test the game by running main.py and simulating gameplay
